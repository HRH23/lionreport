									<p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur 
									varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may 
									still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, 
									neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.</p>

									<h3>Hybrids</h3>
									<p>In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids called 'liger' and 'tigon'. 
									The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress; the tigon or tiglon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger. 
									Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the tigress is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the lion is unimpeded by a 
									regulating gene and the resulting liger grows far larger than either parent. The liger inherits the physical and behavioural 
									qualities of both parent species; its coat has both spots and stripes on a sandy background. Male ligers are sterile but many 
									females are fertile. About half of the males have a mane, which is around half the size of a pure-bred lion mane. 
									The liger is much bigger than a lion and a tiger, typically 3.65 m (12.0 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 500 kg (1,100 lb). 
									In contrast, most tigons are relatively small in comparison with their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.</p>

									<h3>Distribution and habitat</h3>
									<p>The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. 
									It is absent from rainforest and rarely enters closed forest. 
									On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. 
									Lions occur in savannah grasslands with scattered Acacia trees, which serve as shade.</p>
